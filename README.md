Thinking about making it easier to find my repositories in GitHub

I have taken a detour into the world of data cleanup as a member of the data analytics team for BAH.  
Now that the dust has settled a bit, I am rekindling my love for dev.  

But, finding my repositories is quite a challenge, so I would like to create a way to easily locate them.
